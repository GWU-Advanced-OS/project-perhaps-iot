## Questions  

1. Summarize the project, what it is, what its goals are, and why it exists.
2. What is the target domain of the system? Where is it valuable, and where is it not a good fit? These are all implemented in an engineering domain, thus are the product of trade-offs. No system solves all problems (despite the claims of marketing material).
3. What are the "modules" of the system (see early lectures), and how do they relate? Where are isolation boundaries present? How do the modules communicate with each other? What performance implications does this structure have?
4. What are the core abstractions that the system aims to provide. How and why do they depart from other systems?
5. In what conditions is the performance of the system "good" and in which is it "bad"? How does its performance compare to a Linux baseline (this discussion can be quantitative or qualitative)?
6. What are the core technologies involved, and how are they composed?
7. What are the security properties of the system? How does it adhere to the principles for secure system design? What is the reference monitor in the system, and how does it provide complete mediation, tamperproof-ness, and how does it argue trustworthiness?
8. What optimizations exist in the system? What are the "key operations" that the system treats as a fast-path that deserve optimization? How does it go about optimizing them?
9. Subjective: What do you like, and what don't you like about the system? What could be done better were you to re-design it?
