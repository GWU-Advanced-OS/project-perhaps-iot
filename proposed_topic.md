Our team will be working with [Azure RTOS
ThreadX](https://github.com/azure-rtos/threadx). 

ThreadX is a deterministic, embedded RTOS created by Express Logic (acquired by Microsoft) that provides "preemption-threshold, priority inheritance, efficient timer management, fast software timers, picokernel design, event-chaining, and small size: minimal size on an ARM architecture processor is about 2 KB." [referenced from Wikipedia]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ThreadX)
